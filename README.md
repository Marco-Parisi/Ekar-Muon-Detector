# Ekar-Muon-Detector

The **EKAR** muon detector, located at the Cima Ekar observatory in Padua, Italy (https://www.oapd.inaf.it), is an instrument designed by <a href="mailto:antonio.zanardo@tiscali.it">Antonio Zanardo</a> to study _cosmic rays_. I've created this repository to share the firmware of the Arduino board inside the instrument and the software RTCSync used for real-time clock synchronization with UTC time.
